"Huh? Who are you calling losing?"

Background character Nukumizu Kazuhiko witnesses a popular girl, Yanami Anna, getting rejected by another guy.

"Even though he said we'll get married. Don't you think he's pretty mean?"
"When did he say that?"
"When we were 4 or 5 years old."

Nukumizu has no choice but to comfort Yanami, but this leads him to get involved with other losing heroines like Yakishio Lemon from the Track and Field Club and Chika Komari from the Literature Club.

"Nukumizu-kun. There are two types of girls. Childhood friends or cheating cats."
"I see. Well, that's a bold statement."

Bless these girls who only shine after they lose.
